This repository contains my code solutions for several challenges from CodeWars.com website.

With time, I will be adding more code, both based on coding challenges and on other projects. There are two separate
folders in this repository. One of them contains the whole NetBeans project, the other one contains java files. The
code in both folders is exactly the same.

Each challenge is preceded by a title, a short description and a link to its original source page at CodeWars.com.
Some of the solutions are presented as static methods and can be found in the CodingChallenges class. The rest is placed in separate classes.

For each solution there is a dedicated test class, written using JUnit library.
