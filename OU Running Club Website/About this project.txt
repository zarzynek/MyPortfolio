About this project

The files in this folder present part of my final project for the ‘Web, mobile and cloud technologies’ module.
I was asked to design and create a wireframe for a new ‘The Open University Running Club’ website, and then
to create the ‘Mailings’ subpage based on that wireframe. The subpage had to include the html <form> element,
that would use the POST method to send the input from the form to the server hosted by the university.

I have created that project using the tutorials and databases available on w3schools.com .

Please ignore the poor aesthetics of the ‘Mailing’ subpage. The main purpose of this project was to use multiple
HTML and CSS elements, the ‘look and feel’ aspect of the design was not marked.
