About this project

The files in this folder present part of my final project for the �Web, mobile and cloud technologies� module.
I was asked to design and design a wireframe for a new �The Open University Running Club� website, and then
to create the �Mailings� subpage that was based on that wireframe. The subpage had to include the html <form> element,
that would use the POST method to send the input from the form to the server hosted by the university.

I have created that project using the tutorials and databases available on w3schools.com .
